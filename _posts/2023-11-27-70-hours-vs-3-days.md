Narayana Moorthy, the Chairman of Infosys said young Indian Engineers should work for 70 hours a week to boost the country's productivity. Bill Gates says that a 3-day work week is possible with tools and technology.

Even though both are completely contradicting statements, I can understand the rationale behind that. There is a cultural background and the influence of their business background to their statement. Companies like InfoSys operate on the billing hours whereas companies like Microsoft operate on the efficiency of their Softwares. And the target audience is also different - the former is for India (a country where minimum in-time is still required in most of the companies) whereas the latter is for the West.

In the midst of this, AI tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot are reshaping the industry. Personally, I've found ChatGPT streamlining my work—from drafting emails to coding. Tools like CoPilot promise a future where we focus on business logic, not tedious code issues 💻. Tasks which took hours before can be done in minutes now.

But, the question remains: Do these advancements mean we should work more or less? 🤔
