Last week, while in the cafeteria, someone from my company recognized me and commended the assistance I provided for their project. Despite having engaged in numerous virtual meetings in the past, this person was able to identify me, whereas I struggled to recall who they were. The reason behind this asymmetry was simple: I had a profile picture set up in my work profile, whereas they did not. Throughout our interactions, even when our cameras were off, my profile picture would appear in the meeting tab, while I was only greeted by their initials.

It's not uncommon to encounter individuals who neglect to set a profile picture in their work-related accounts, even though they might frequently update their profile pictures on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. 

Although most companies don't force the employees to set profile picture, having one will significantly affects in how you are perceived and it can lead to numerous benefits in your career.

1. It humanize you - When most of our interactions happens online, a profile picture adds a personal touch to you. It will literally put a face to your name (like in my case)
2. It creates a brand - People often browse about you before connecting with you. When you have a profile picture, it makes them remember who you are
3. Networking - Profile picture makes it easier for your colleagues, clients to connect with you and on a personal level.
4. Opportunities - Good profile picture can make your profile stand out from the crowd and may even make you more attractive to potential employers, leading to increased job opportunities

and the list goes on. So people, set a profile picture.
