Have you ever found yourself in a situation where a colleague asks for your help with their tasks, but you are already overwhelmed with your own workload? You want to say "No," but something holds you back from voicing it aloud. Similarly, perhaps someone sends you a meeting invite at a time that doesn't fit your schedule. You respond with a hesitant "Yes" or "Maybe," but "No" never seems to make its way out. This is a common case particularly among us Indians. 
We often hear about the importance of saying "Yes" to new opportunities, projects, and collaborations. But what about the power of saying "No"? As simple as it may seem, mastering the art of politely declining can truly transform the dynamics in the workplace.
One of the primary reasons we tend to default to "Yes" is the desire to please everyone. Many times, the person seeking your assistance might not be aware of your existing workload. By consistently saying "Yes," you risk overcommitting yourself, which can eventually lead to burnout â€” a fact that the other person may not even realize. While saying "No" may initially feel counterintuitive, understanding when and how to do so can prove advantageous for both you and your team. It is okay to say 'No' in many occasions. As an added note, you can say the reason you are saying 'No' and you can offer alternatives (like you can take a lookt at it later, or you can help them in a different way, etc.)
