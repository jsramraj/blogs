Have faced a situation where you come back to your workstation and you see a message from your co-worker which says just 'Hi'? I hate messages like these. Obviously that co-worker needs some information from me. I don't know what it is. Now I have to type 'Hi' and wait for his message to know what he wants. This is lost productivity.

You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question.

The same goes for "Hello -- Are you there?", "Hi Bob -- quick question.", "Do you have a sec ?", "there?" and "ping". Just ask the question!

Use something like, "Hello, @person! Do you have a moment to discuss about the new estimates?" or "Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]"

Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.
