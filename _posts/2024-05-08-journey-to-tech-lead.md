Recently I got promoted as a Technical Lead. But the thing is, I was already a Technical Lead even before I joined Trimble and it took seven years for me to get my old title back. Meanwhile many of my old collegues are Project Managers now 

Does this bother me? No, not at all. (Let's not forget that the titles and positions differ from companies to companies)

People think success means climbing up the corporate ladder as quickly as possible. But I value the learnings and the challenges more than the titles and positions. But it is just me, doesn't have to be the same for all.

Throughout this journey,

- I made some good friends
- Lived a little
- Learnt 5 new technologies
- Overseen the development and maintainance of tons of applications (ranging from a small 2 page utility applications to applications with countless screens and complex workflows)
- Optimized numerous processes
- Even crashed a production app once. Yep, that happened.

I have learnt so many things from all these. And I am excited for what challenges and opportunities this new role will offer. I know this is not the end of the journey and the best is yet to come.
