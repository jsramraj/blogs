   In the age of smartphones and digital world, services like Uber and Ola have become integral part of our lives. With just a few taps, you can summon a ride at your dootsteps. However, behind all these, there lies a complex infrastucture powered by software, which is often underappreciated by both passengers and drivers.
   
   
   Everytime I book a auto ride in Ola/Uber, the drivers always voiced their frustration about giving commissions to these companies. They argue that while they spend huge amount of money in buying the auto, paying taxes, buying petrol, these companies do nothing besides connecting the passengers and the drivers yet they charge a great amount of their "hardearned" money as commissions. What they fail to recognize is, these companies invested a whole lot of money in building these softwares and inftastructures.
   
   It is easy to overlook the value of a software as it runs in background, but the reality is far more than that. Developing and maintaining a robust platform capable of handling million of users and billions of requests at the same time without compromising security and privacy requires a huge investment in technology, talent and infrastructure. The software you are using in your day to day life does not comes out from a magic box all by itself. A whole team of Business Analysts, Project Managers, Designers, Architects, Developers, Testers spent countless hours in building such softwares. And it is not also a one time investment. These softwares need to be continuously maintained in order to adapt to ever changing market, user needs, new devices and platforms. All these things costs money. 
   
   Despite all these efforts, people think softwares should be free. People choose free software over paid softwares, or they will go for pirated versions compromising the security and their privacy. People are willing to pay for physical goods and services but when it comes to software, they are reluctant to pay. People who buy mobile phones for more than a lakh rupees don't spend a penny in softwares. So who do you think will pay for people in the IT industry? YOU are. But until recently you were paying the money Indirectly. But when these platforms started charging money from you directly in the name of Platform Fees or Convenience Fees, people are going crazy.
   
   So, next time you book a ride or order a food, pause and think about the industry that made it possible. Appreciate them and be thankful!!!. After all, their dedication and innovation made your lives easier.
